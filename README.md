# BubbleSort-Algorithm
Bubble sort is a sorting Algorithm that iterates through a list and compares pairings of adjacent elements. Bubble sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm. Bubble sortâ€™s worst-case runtime is O(n^2). This is because we have to compare the current element we are looking at, to each element in the array after it and repeat this check for every single element in the array. Its best-case runtime is O(n) for an already-sorted list.
